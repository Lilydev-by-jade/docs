# Contributing

Before contributing, please check that there's not a separate "Contributing" page specific to that project on this website. If there is, follow the instructions on that page instead!

If you would like to contribute, fork the repository, make some changes, and then make a pull request for it in the project repository.
I'll review it as soon as I can, but please don't be upset if your changes aren't merged! Sometimes it's just not the right fit for the project.
