# Installing & Updating

## Installing

See [Modrinth's documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/#how-do-i-play-a-modpack) for now!

## Updating

Right now, I only have a guide for Prism Launcher, but I may make more for other launchers in the future.

### Prism Launcher
