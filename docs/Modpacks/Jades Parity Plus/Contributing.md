Jade's Parity Plus is a bit different than a lot of other modpacks, in the sense that it's a modpack that I made to fit my own personal needs, rather than to serve a community's needs.
This doesn't mean that other people can't use it, it just means that contributions may not be merged, simply because it's not something I want in my pack.

If you have any mods you think should be added, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/jadelily18/jades-parity-plus/issues) on GitHub detailing why you think it should be added and Modrinth links to each respective mod. I'll try to reply to it or implement it as soon as I can!
